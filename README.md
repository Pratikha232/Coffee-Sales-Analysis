# Coffee-Sales-Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive Coffee Sales Analysis project, featuring an interactive and dynamic sales dashboard. The dashboard was built to provide insights into coffee sales performance through visualizations, using pivot tables and charts to highlight trends and key metrics. Advanced Excel formulas, including VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP, were employed to efficiently manage data and enhance analysis accuracy. The project demonstrates a practical approach to sales analysis, delivering actionable insights through a visually intuitive dashboard.

I have also included the original datasheet, so that changes can be distinguished and work can be done easily.
